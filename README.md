**To test the program**, you must have a windows operating system (tested on it) and go to Project/Alpha/*.exe. 

Download the Alpha folder and run *.exe in it so that all the components are together.

**For the application to work**, you need to enter all the values and save them, then you can change them one at a time (to save, click the button at the bottom of the input)
